# Bike Share

## Abstract

In this project uses Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application collects data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application provides a number of user dashboards(stations dashboard, trips dashboard and weather dashboard) with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.
